# Day 1 (2025-07-05)

I worked through chapter 1 of the Brown University's version of the Rust Book, which henceforward I'll be calling the _Brown Book_.

I also replaced my native Rust setup from Arch Linux with a `rustup`-based setup, which `rustup` coming in as an Arch Linux package. This way, I don't have to execute shell code coming unvetted from the internet, but still can use `rustup` and its components, e.g. the local Rust documentation.
