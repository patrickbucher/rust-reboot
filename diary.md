# Day 2 (2025-07-06)

Working through chapter 3 of the Brown Book showed me the value of the added quizzes: Going through the introductory material is mostly about re-activating the knowledge I already acquired a year ago; but once I get quiz answers wrong, I have to dig deeper.

I worked through chapter 3 and did all the exercises, which are rather helpful at this stage for warming up again.

# Day 1 (2025-07-05)

I worked through chapter 1 of the Brown University's version of the Rust Book, which henceforward I'll be calling the _Brown Book_.

I also replaced my native Rust setup from Arch Linux with a `rustup`-based setup, which `rustup` coming in as an Arch Linux package. This way, I don't have to execute shell code coming unvetted from the internet, but still can use `rustup` and its components, e.g. the local Rust documentation.

In the afternoon, I also worked through chapter 2.
