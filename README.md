Having spent [half a year with Rust](https://github.com/patrickbucher/learning-rust) in 2024, I'd like to pick it up again. This time, I'd like to focus on the following topics during the summer of 2025:

1. Really understanding ownership, lifetimes and smart pointers.
2. Using the methods of `Optional` and `Result` for more concise code.
3. Learning about async Rust and a specific async runtime, e.g. Tokio.
4. Learning a Rust web framework for productive use, e.g. Toxio's axum.
5. Learning a SQL toolkit, e.g. sqlx for productive use.

I'd like to master the first two items so that I can explain it to another person in written or spoken language without any helping material.

In the last three items, I'd like to become fluent so that I can use those technologies productively.

Rust is the only programming language I consider to be truly all purpose, and the languages brings great benefits comparing to most other options. There's no reason to aim lower, and only very few reasons to aim higher (at Haskell, that is).

Why did I stop working with Rust in the last fall?

1) I needed to learn some web technologies.
2) My experience with the actix web framework was rather disappointing, which was mostly due to the book I was working through.
3) I had other, more pressing things to do.

So keeping the good stuff (the Rust programming language), re-iterating on the hard stuff (ownership and the like) and finally learning the unknown stuff (async) looks quite motivating for me. So I'd like to see how far six weeks will bring me; then I can extend to three or maybe six months. (The alternative is Elixir.)

I won't be writing a complete summary about all the aspects, but some _Notes on Rust_ covering particularly challenging topics, which I'd like to publish as a series of articles on my personal websites. This is me explaining the hard stuff to my uneducated self.

I'll be using the modified and extended version of the Rust Book from Brown University for this purpose ([link](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/)).

But now, let's get _rusty_ again!

PS: No AI, no fancy text editors; just the official Rust distribution, Vim, Bash and my brain.
